## The challenges, embarrassments, losses & wins of Rails World 24

**Hello world**, I had the honor of attending Rails World 2024 after winning a contest through IndieRails and Buzzsprout!

I never win anything! Let's go!!!

I was a little nervous but ready...

### challenges that were actually wins

- The WI-FI went out right before my pair coding session with Shopify!

### embarrassments that were actually wins

- I typed my password in front of two devs after they repeatedly looked away!

### losses that were actually wins

- I did not resolve my shopify_app gem issue.


### wins that were actually wins

- I met & talked with Chris Oliver!


#### What a great conference, woo hoo!
