## Reviewing My Challenges, Embarrassments, Fails, Losses, and Wins at Rails World 2024

First: the title is purposefully misleading, there are only *wins*.

**Hello world**, My name is Tygh Walters. I had the honor of attending Rails World 2024 after winning a contest through IndieRails and Buzzsprout!


I had the exquisite privilege to unexpectedly attend Rails World through an interaction with the Indy rails podcast on x. link to post. that interaction led to the acquisition of my ticket and for the past 3 weeks have been on a energizing Journey. 

I never win anything! Let's go!!!

I was a little nervous but readyâ€¦

Above a, I committed to leaning into the conference as much as I could. Participate in most discussions, 

- Made an X post per day about my conference prep
- Submitted a Lightning Talk - did not get accepted
- Signed-up for two pair-coding sessions with Shopify and Test Double
- Read all the posts, click all the links, etc. 

You could say that I started running up the Rails ramp instead of walking or standing. I'm here, and moving faster towards proficiency and happiness.

## challenges that were actually wins

- The WI-FI went out right before my pair coding session with Shopify! 
-- Actually a win because 
--- I was reminded how vital having a reliable source of personal internet can be!

I was nervously scrambling the session before my pair-coding but let me set the scene.

Days before rails world a sign up form for the Shopify and test double pair coding sessions were shared.

## Embarrassments that were actually wins

- dirty screen! Ew. Never saw my laptop in the light before - I work in a basement. 
-- Actually a win because I just ordered a cleaning kit!
- I typed my password in front of two devs after they repeatedly looked away!
-- Actually a win because I re-learned how to reset my password


## Fails that were actually wins
- I did not resolve my shopify_app gem issue.
-- Actually a win because I learned about why Rails is not the golden path to create a new Shopify app. 


## Losses that were actually wins
- I lost the notion that "solo traveling is not important". That's a win. 
-- Actually a win because being OK or even rejuvenated alone is alright!


## More Wins

- Met & talked with Chris Oliver!
- 3 levels of Shopify office craziness!
- First time in Canada!
- Top quality merch & stickers acquired

### What a great conference, woo hoo!
