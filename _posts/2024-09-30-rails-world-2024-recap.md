First, sorry, the title is misleading. *Here*, there are only wins underneath it all.

## Hello (Rails) world

My name is Tygh Walters, and this is my story of having the exquisite privilege to unexpectedly attend [Rails World](https://rubyonrails.org/world/) 2024 in Toronto Canada! 

It happened by a chance interaction with the IndieRails podcast account on social media. I answered a question and won a ticket sponsored by Buzzsprout to only the second Rails World which had sold out (in less than an hour) months before.

What a serendipity! I never win anything!! LFG!!! 

Since that day and for the past several weeks I've been on an energizing journey to soak it all up and put this fortune to good use! 

I'll admit, I was a bit nervous `{self_doubt: 'Am I developer enough?'}` but overall ready to show up and engage!

I can only control what I do and think, not what happens. 

I committed to doing it all, leaning into the conference as much as I could, before, during and after. How?:

- Made an [28-post thread on X](https://x.com/TyghWalters/status/1830667320378958222), one per day re: behinds the scenes of my conference prep
- Joined & participated in online Campfire discussions 
- Submitted a Lightning Talk "'The Rails Way' to Do Customer Service" - did not get accepted
- Signed-up for two pair-coding sessions with Shopify and Test Double devs
- Introduced myself to many fellow attendees
- Read all the posts and clicked all the links

You could say that I started jogging intently up the Rails ramp instead of casually strolling. 

I'm accelerating; moving faster towards proficiency and happiness and trying to repay the debt of gratitude I had for attending.

## Challenges that were actually wins

- The Rails World WI-FI glitched right before my pair coding session with Shopify! 
  - Actually a win because 
    - I was reminded how vital having a reliable source of personal internet can be!
    - I got paired with a dev that knew something about it so we started trouble shooting there and he even let me tether to his device. '

## Fails that were actually wins
- I failed resolve my confusion with the [shopify_app gem](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify_app). One of my goals is to try and get a vanilla Rails app working as a Shopify app it it has not been easy so far. 
  - Actually a win because 
   - I learned why Remix and not Rails is not the golden path to create a new Shopify app. 
   - I feel like I got set on a personal path to figure this out and connect the dots for myself and others: How can one use Rails without frills to write Shopify apps!? 
- My dirty laptop screen! Ew. Never saw my laptop in the light of the late morning Brick Works before - I work in a dark basement in Seattle where the sun is rare. 
  - Actually a win because I just ordered a cleaning kit and wont let anyone else see that mess again.
- During a pairing sessions, I repeatedly typed my admin password incorrectly in front of two devs after they repeatedly aided me by looking away, then I typed it in plain command line text for them to see, twice!! LOL.
  - Actually a win because they were kind and I re-learned how to reset my password and now it's re-secured + I have better security habits.

## Losses that were actually wins
- I lost the notion that "solo traveling is not important". 
  - Actually a win because being OK or even rejuvenated by being alone is alright! 

## More Wins that are pure wins

- Met & talked with: 
  - Chris Oliver about his customer service
  - Aaron Patterson about his closing keynote
  - Jess from IndieRails about his multiple apps!
  - Adam from Judoscale at the Clio party
- First time in Canada - had a Beaver tail and poutine!
- All the info & stories shared in the tracks and Lightning talks
- Top quality merch & stickers acquired
- Saw downtown Toronto: walked dozens of miles and three levels of Shopify office craziness to cap it off!
- Reignited my drive to give back, contribute anf build!

### What a great conference, woo hoo!

## What's next?

Use Blue Drumlin to make things with Rails for real paying customers! 

Growing something that can give and give back.
