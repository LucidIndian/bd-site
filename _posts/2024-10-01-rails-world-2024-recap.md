Sorry, the title is misleading. *Here*, there are only wins.

## Hello (Rails) world

My name is Tygh Walters, and this is my story of having the exquisite privilege to unexpectedly attend [Rails World](https://rubyonrails.org/world/) 2024 in Toronto Canada! 

It happened by a chance interaction with the IndieRails podcast account on social media. I answered a question and won a ticket sponsored by Buzzsprout to only the second Rails World which had sold out (in less than an hour) months before.

What a serendipity! I never win anything!! LFG!!! 

Since that day and for the past several weeks I've been on an energizing journey to soak it all up and put this fortune to good use! 

I'll admit, I was a bit nervous `{self_doubt: 'Am I developer enough?'}` but overall ready to show up and engage!

I can only control what I do and think, not what happens. 

I committed to doing it all. Leaning into the conference as much as I could, before, during and after. How?:

- Made an [28-post thread on X](https://x.com/TyghWalters/status/1830667320378958222), one per day re: behinds the scenes of my conference prep
- Joined & participated in online Campfire discussions 
- Submitted a Lightning Talk "'The Rails Way' to Do Customer Service" - did not get accepted
- Signed-up for two pair-coding sessions with Shopify and Test Double devs
- Introduced myself to many fellow attendees
- Read all the posts and clicked all the links
- Completed the feedback survey

You could say that I started jogging with intention up the Rails ramp instead of casually strolling along. 

I'm still accelerating; moving faster dup the long ramp towards proficiency and happiness while trying to repay the debt of gratitude I have.

## Challenges that were actually wins

### No internet

The Rails World WI-FI glitched right before my pair coding session with Shopify! 

Actually a win because 
1. I was reminded how vital having a reliable source of personal internet can be! My international network plan throttled my usage until it was down to 3G only by 11am. 
2. I got paired with a dev that knew something about it so we started trouble shooting there and he even let me tether to his device.

## Fails that were actually wins

### shopify_app gem

I failed resolve my confusion with the [shopify_app gem](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify_app). One of my goals is to get a vanilla Rails app working as a Shopify app. Shopify created a way to do this but it has recently become incompatible with the gem, at least I believe!?

Actually a win because: 
1. I learned why Remix and not Rails is the golden path to create a new Shopify app. 
2. I feel like I got solidly set on a personal vendetta/path to figure this out once and for all, to connect the dots for myself and others: How can we use Rails without frills to write Shopify apps that work!? 

### My dirty laptop screen! 

Ew. Never saw my laptop in the light of the late morning Brick Works. I work in a dark basement in Seattle where the sunshine is rare. 

Actually a win because I just ordered a cleaning kit and wont let anyone else see that mess again.

### Password exposed!

During a pairing session with Test Double, I repeatedly typed my admin password incorrectly in front of two devs after they repeatedly aided me by looking away, then I repeated to type it in plain command line text for them to see!! LOL.

Actually a win because they were kind and I re-learned how to reset my password and now it's re-secured + I have better security habits.

## Losses that were actually wins

I lost the notion that "solo traveling is not important". Actually a win because being OK or even rejuvenated by being alone is alright! 

Lost the idea that I am not ready to build and contribute. Actually a win because now I have more perceived agency, I thought I could do a lot before, but now, almost anything is possible!

## More Wins

-  Met & talked with: 
    - Chris Oliver about his customer service
    - Andrea Formera about her Rails World talk
    - Adam McCrea from Judoscale at the Clio party
    - Jeremy & Jess from IndieRails 
    - Aaron Patterson about his closing keynote
    - and many more friendly and smart people!
- First time in Canada - Beaver tail and Poutine!
- All the info & stories shared in the tracks and Lightning talks
- Top quality merch & stickers acquired
- Saw downtown Toronto: walked dozens of miles through various neighborhoods and districts and three levels of Shopify office craziness to cap it off!
- Reignited my drive to give back: [reviewed an open PR for the Rails Guides](https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/52951#issuecomment-2391916720)
- contribute and build!

### What a great conference, woo hoo!

## What's next?

Like you, I have a unique combination of skills and experiences. Some of mine are: football, exercise science, customer service, e-commerce, Rails, and creating bootstrapped businesses.

At this stage, I feel like the biggest way, the best way for me to contribute, my "calling" may be to use these skills to build a successful business, or several, with Ruby on Rails. One that could become a Rails World sponsor some day. One that can afford to hire Senior and early careers Rails devs.

I want to do this as another proof of concept, to prove an app can thrive after launch and before IPO, but also as something that is a significant generator of financial capital. Money talks. 

I will use Blue Drumlin to make things with Rails for real paying customers! 

Growing something that can give to me and give back to the community!
