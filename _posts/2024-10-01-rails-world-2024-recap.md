Sorry, the title is misleading. *Here*, there are only wins.

## Hello (Rails) world

My name is Tygh Walters, and this is my story of having the exquisite privilege to unexpectedly attend [Rails World](https://rubyonrails.org/world/) 2024 in Toronto, Canada! 

It happened by a chance interaction with the IndieRails podcast account on social media. I answered a question and won a ticket sponsored by Buzzsprout to only the second Rails World which had sold out (in less than an hour) months before.

What a serendipity! I never win anything!! LFG!!! 

Since that day and for the past several weeks I've been on an energizing journey to soak it all up and put this fortune to good use! 

I'll admit, I was a bit nervous `{self_doubt: 'Am I developer enough?'}` but ready to show up and engage!

I can only control what I do and think, not what happens. 

I committed to doing it all. Leaning into the conference as much as I could, before, during and after. How?:

- Made an [28-post thread on X](https://x.com/TyghWalters/status/1830667320378958222), one per day re: behinds the scenes of my conference prep
- Joined & participated in online Campfire discussions 
- Submitted a Lightning Talk "'The Rails Way' to Do Customer Service" - did not get accepted
- Signed-up for two pair-coding sessions with Shopify and Test Double devs
- Introduced myself to many fellow attendees
- Read all the posts and clicked all the links
- Completed the feedback survey

You could say that I started jogging with intention up the long Rails ramp instead of casually strolling along. 

I'm still accelerating; moving faster towards proficiency and happiness while trying to repay the debt of gratitude I have.

## Challenges that were actually wins

### No internet

The Rails World WI-FI glitched right before my pair coding session with Shopify! 

Actually a win because 
1. I was reminded how vital having a reliable source of personal internet can be! My international network plan throttled my usage until it was down to 3G only by 11am. 
2. I got paired with a gracious dev that knew something about it so we started troubleshooting and he even let me tether to his device.

## Fails that were actually wins

### shopify_app gem

I failed to resolve my confusion around the [shopify_app gem](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify_app). One of my goals is to get a vanilla Rails app working as a Shopify app. Shopify created this gem for us but it appears it has recently become incompatible with Shopify's new managed installation, at least I believe it has!? To bo continued...

Actually a win because: 
1. I learned why Remix and not Rails is the golden path to create a new Shopify app. Shopify owns Remix!
2. I learned how to prepare better for a pair-coding session. If I had localized or described my situation with more specificity, it may have led to more meaningful work and a breakthrough. Proper Preparation Prevents Poor Performance!
3. I feel like I got solidly set on a personal quest to figure this out once and for all, to connect the dots for myself and others: How can we use Rails to write Shopify apps that work!? 

Making it easier for Rails devs to build for the largest Rails app in the world seems like a connection that needs to happen! THis will be a future post.

### My dirty laptop screen! 

Ew. Never before have I seen my laptop screen in the late-morning light of the Brick Works building. I work in a dark basement in Seattle where the sunshine is rare. 

Fingerprints and a lot of who knows what. 

Actually a win because I just ordered [a laptop cleaning kit](https://amzn.to/3Y6SVC6) and wont let anyone else see that mess again.

### Password exposed!

During a pairing session with Test Double, I repeatedly typed my admin password incorrectly in front of two devs after they repeatedly aided me by looking away, then I repeated to type it in plain command line text for them to see!! LOL.

How did that happen? The Test Double dev was asking me perform some actions. Specifically, we started typing more CLI code than I typically do. When the CLI prompted me for my password, I had  assumed it was my Git password instead of my MacBook user's password. 

Actually a win because they were kind about it. I relearned how to reset my password, it's re-secured, and I have better security habits going forward.

"Itâ€™s important to change your login password from time to time to protect your privacy." [Change the login password on Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/change-the-login-password-on-mac-mchlp1550/mac)


## Losses that were actually wins

### Lost the idea that "solo traveling is not important"

Actually a win because being OK or even rejuvenated by being alone occasionally is good! 

### Lost the idea that I am not ready to build & contribute 

Actually a win because now I have more perceived agency, and responsibility. I thought I could do a lot before, but now, almost anything is possible!

-  Reignited my drive to build!

What a great conference, thank you to all that made it happen!

## What's next?

Like you, I have a unique combination of skills and experiences. Some of mine are: football, exercise science, customer service, e-commerce, Rails, and creating bootstrapped businesses.

At this stage, I feel like the biggest way, the best way for me to contribute, my "calling", may be to use these skills to build a  business, or several, with Ruby on Rails. One that could become a Rails World sponsor some day. One that could potentially IPO!? One that hires senior and early career Rails devs alike.

I'm going to do this, but I want to do this in Rails, as another proof of concept, but to test what others say is true: that Rails is the best way for one person to test ideas and then to make them go farther.

I'm going to build an app can thrive after launch and before IPO.

I will use Blue Drumlin to make beautiful and useful things with Ruby & Rails for real paying customers!

Growing something that can fulfill me and give back to the community that made it possible!
